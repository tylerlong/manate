## **`shouldRecompute`**

### **Signature**

```typescript
shouldRecompute: (writeLog: WriteLog, readLog: ReadLog) => boolean;
```

### **Description**

The `shouldRecompute` function determines whether a previously evaluated, side-effect-free function would produce a different result if re-executed. It achieves this by analyzing the relationship between **write events** (`writeLog`) and **read events** (`readLog`).

This is useful for dependency tracking, caching, or optimization scenarios where unnecessary recomputation should be avoided unless a meaningful change has occurred.

### **Parameters**

1. **`writeLog`** (`WriteLog`):

   - A log containing write events that describe changes made to the state or objects.
   - Typically structured as a map where keys represent targets (e.g., objects), and values are maps of properties with their associated changes.

2. **`readLog`** (`ReadLog`):
   - A log containing read events that describe which properties or keys of a target were accessed during the previous execution.
   - Typically structured as a map where keys represent targets, and values describe read dependencies.

### **Returns**

- **`boolean`**:
  - Returns `true` if changes in the `writeLog` would cause the function described by `readLog` to produce a different result.
  - Returns `false` if no meaningful changes are detected, and recomputation can be skipped.

### **Example Usage**

```typescript
import { shouldRecompute } from 'manate';

const result = shouldRecompute(writeLog, readLog);
console.log(result); // true or false
```

### **How It Works**

1. Iterates over all entries in the `writeLog` to analyze changes made to targets and their properties.
2. For each entry in the `writeLog`, checks if the corresponding target exists in the `readLog`.
3. Compares:
   - Whether written values differ from the previously accessed values (`get` operations).
   - Whether property existence checks (`has` operations) are invalidated.
   - Whether changes to keys (`keys` operations) affect the tracked target.
4. If any of the above conditions indicate a change that could affect the result, the function returns `true`.

### **Use Cases**

- **Dependency Tracking**:
  - Use `shouldRecompute` to decide whether to re-execute a function in reactive systems (e.g., UI frameworks, data pipelines).
- **Performance Optimization**:

  - Avoid unnecessary recomputation in computationally expensive operations by detecting when results are truly invalidated.

- **Caching Systems**:
  - Invalidate cached results only when the underlying dependencies have changed.
